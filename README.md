# Quanten Cryptographie
## Introduction
When it is important to communicate securely over the internet, one has to ensure a encrypted method to transfer Data. This is done by encrypting the Data via various, usually mathematical based techniques. Now with the wider acces to Quanten Computers these conventional techniques can be decrpyted with new algorithms and additionally new 

The widely used encryption techniques today are usually based on one hand the symmetrical techniques with, for example the "Advanced Encryption Standart" (AES) or the "Data Encryption Standard" (DES) and on the other hand the assymetrical techniques like the "RSA"-Procedure. Altough there is an ongoing struggle between encrypters and decrypters, the above listed techniques are still usable in real world scenarios. Although the symmetrical techniques have been cracked in theoretical cases, symmetrical and asymmetrical techniques are still in use.

Now with the wider access to Quanten Computers a third technique enters the cryptographie landscape, Quanten cryptographie. This new technique differentiates between Quanten cryptographie and Post-Quanten cryptographie.

The term Quanten-Computer was first coined in 1985 by a british Physic David Deutsch. His assumptions regarding the operating principle are still valid today and are widely implemented. His **thoughts** were that a quanten computer had to work with so called "Qubits", like regular electronical computers these "Qubits" behave like a bits. Meaning beeing in astate of 1 and 0. But "Qubits" have the property of beeing in a superposition meaning a 1 and a 0 at the same time, opposing to regular computers, who can be either 1 or 0. The result of this is that  [4]
